            <h4>Education to learners with special needs</h4>
            Education is fundamental for the development of the individual as
            well as for the welfare of the society. Education is not only about
            studies. It is also about how one develops his/her ideas and
            imaginations and grows up into a unique human. On the left is a
            picture of scribes helping the differently abled learn !

            <h4>Extending a helping hand</h4>
            There no doubt the visually impaired children will contribute to
            the society and create wonders provided they have a proper access to
            reading materials. Our education becomes meaningless when it cannot
            be even useful to enrich one fellow being who has certain special
            needs

            Why not help them out when you can do . The main goal is to build
            strategies which could make them learn easier and better. When
            everyone keeps talking about the change, we thought why not we be
            the change !
